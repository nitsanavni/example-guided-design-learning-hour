# Convert Example to Test Case

Convert [the example from the kata description](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/shopping_basket.html) to a test case. (5% discount)

**Do not implement the code - only write the test.**

Use the following files:

- [shopping-basket-1.test.ts](shopping-basket-1.test.ts)
- [shopping-basket-2.test.ts](shopping-basket-2.test.ts)

When you're done, copy the test to replace those snippets:

## Design Idea 1

```ts
test("5% discount", () => {
  expect(true).toBe(false);
});
```

## Design Idea 2

```ts
test("5% discount", () => {
  expect(true).toBe(false);
});
```
