# How do you use examples to guide design?

## Are there any advantages to doing it this way?

- Adv: purpose is clearer - what is it we need to do? It's very readable: Input -> Output
- you know what the "answer" should be, so you have clear goal in mind when building the design
- starting smaller is easier; easier to wrap your head around th idea while writing the functionality; as opposed to the big picture
- feels less overwhelming
- small increments - same


## does it affect the resulting design?

- it might...
- we could find out by doing it all over again without example-guided
